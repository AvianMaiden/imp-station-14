## Character Records

You can create records for you characters in the records tab of the character
creator. Simply fill in the values and save. Entries should typically be
written from the perspective of a CentComm official or other supervisor.

## General/Employment Entries

Employee Entries should include your character's education, previous jobs, and
anything that you think Nanotrasen would log about your characters past that is
employment related. This also serves as a catch-all for any non-medical non-security
entries that are on-file.

## Medical Entries

Medical Entries should include anything a doctor should know before treating
your character; major surgeries, prescriptions, and any psychological evaluations.

## Security Entries

Security Entries should include any major arrests/incidents your character has
had in the past or while working with Nanotrasen. Minor incidents should
generally be avoided.

## Accessing Records
You can access the records of your crewmates in game from their respective consoles.

Records can only be written in the character customization menu and not during
a round.
